This app is only available for users that do not reside in the USA & Canada. Check out the Yale Access app in case you are!

With Yale Smart Locks and the Yale Home app, you can check who comes and when with your phone – whether you're there or not. You're just a tap away from locking up, sending virtual keys to trusted friends and family or checking if the kids got home on time.

Homey will let your Yale Smart Lock work seamlessly with all your smart devices at home. Create flows that will be activated by locking and unlocking the door with your Yale Home enabled smart locks such as the latest Linus®  Smart Lock. For example, as soon as you come home, Homey will play your favourite tunes, turn on the lights, turn up the heating, and even open up the curtains.

We can't say you won't lift a finger. But that's all you have to do.
